# t2maps

This is a collection of Tribes 2 maps that were available on "the pond" server.

* [PondMaps.zip](./PondMaps.zip) is a collection of all maps in the [maps](./maps) directory. These weren't all in rotation, but they were available for voting if nothing else.
* [PondMapsExtra.vl2](./PondMapsExtra.vl2) is a collection of client-side maps. At the time, it was called the "PondPack".
